RBDL
====

This library can be obtained from the bitbucket repo (mercurial) at:
     https://bitbucket.org/rbdl/rbdl

The version currently used is 2.5.0 and the mercurial changeset is
    1023:d5550334c3d1 (Sun Dec 11 2016)

Changes to the original RBDL package are:

  + The following folders/files have been removed (they are not used by this
    project): doc, Doxyfile, examples, python, utils, tests, addons/benchmark,
    addons/luamodel, hidden folders,

  + Add line 26 to simply use "lib" to install libraries (instead of
    architecture dependent library paths).

  + Add -lrbdl_urdfreader in line 11 of rbdl.pc.cmake (Libs) since urdf support
    is essential for OSCR

  + Line 14 of addons/urdfreader/urdfreader.cc was commented out since it
    causes problems when ros.h is not found (e.g. with ros kinetic)

    benchmark, hidden folders

  + Commented out lines 22, 144-148, 352-353, 359, 362 in CMakeLists.txt to

  + The library has been changed to SHARED: line 104 in CMakeLists.txt has been
    commented out and line 105 has been added
